<p><h1>Infertility Testing Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Application, Regional Outlook, Competitive Strategies, And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Infertility Testing Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Infertility testing refers to a series of medical examinations and procedures conducted to identify the underlying causes of the inability to conceive a child. It involves a comprehensive assessment of both male and female reproductive systems to determine if there are any abnormalities or other issues that may be hindering successful conception.</p><p>The infertility testing market has witnessed significant growth in recent years and is expected to continue expanding at a CAGR of 8.9% during the forecast period. Several factors contribute to this growth, including increasing awareness about infertility and the availability of advanced diagnostic technologies. Additionally, changing lifestyles, rising stress levels, and postponement of pregnancy are also contributing to the rising number of infertility cases.</p><p>One of the major trends in the infertility testing market is the shift towards non-invasive diagnostic techniques.
