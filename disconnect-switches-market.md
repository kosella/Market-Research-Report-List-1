<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disconnect Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fused Disconnector Switch</li><li>Non-Fused Disconnector Switch</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Disconnect switches are devices used to isolate electrical circuits from the power supply for maintenance or safety purposes. The fused disconnector switch is equipped with fuses that can interrupt the flow of current when needed, providing overload and short-circuit protection. On the other hand, non-fused disconnector switches do not have fuses and are mainly used for switching purposes without providing any protective functions. Both types of disconnect switches are commonly used in various applications where the interruption of electrical circuits is required.</p></p>
