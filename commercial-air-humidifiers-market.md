<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Air Humidifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vapor Type Humidifier</li><li>Water Spray Humidifier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial air humidifiers come in two main types: vapor type humidifiers and water spray humidifiers. Vapor type humidifiers work by heating water until it evaporates, then releasing the water vapor into the air. These are more efficient and suitable for larger spaces. On the other hand, water spray humidifiers use a spray nozzle to disperse water droplets into the air. They are easier to maintain and often used in smaller areas. Both types serve the purpose of adding moisture to the air and maintaining optimal humidity levels in commercial settings.</p></p>
