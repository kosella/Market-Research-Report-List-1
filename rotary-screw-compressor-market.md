<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary-screw Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-free</li><li>Oil-injected</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary-screw compressors are used in various industries to convert power into potential energy stored in compressed air. The market for rotary-screw compressors can be classified into two main types: oil-free and oil-injected. Oil-free compressors do not use oil for lubrication, reducing the risk of oil contamination in the compressed air, making them suitable for applications that require clean and oil-free air, such as food and pharmaceutical industries. On the other hand, oil-injected compressors use oil for lubrication, allowing for improved cooling and sealing, making them suitable for heavy-duty applications in industries like manufacturing and construction.</p></p>
