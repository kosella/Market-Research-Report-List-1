<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desktop Security Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulse Induction</li><li>Very Low Frequency</li><li>Beat-frequency Oscillation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The desktop security scanner market can be classified into three types: pulse induction, very low frequency, and beat-frequency oscillation. Pulse induction scanners use electromagnetic pulses to detect metal objects while ignoring natural occurring minerals. Very low frequency scanners work by emitting a continuous wave and measuring the changes in electromagnetic fields caused by metal objects. Beat-frequency oscillation scanners utilize two oscillators to generate a beat frequency, with a change indicating the presence of metal. These scanners are used for various applications in desktop security for efficient and reliable detection and prevention of unauthorized items.</p></p>
