<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ring Type Joint Flanges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Threaded</li><li>Slip-On</li><li>Welding Neck</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Ring Type Joint Flanges market includes three major types: Threaded, Slip-On, and Welding Neck flanges. Threaded flanges contain internal threads for pipe attachment and are commonly used in low-pressure applications. Slip-On flanges slide over the pipe and are then welded for secure attachment, suitable for moderate-pressure applications. Welding Neck flanges have a long tapered hub allowing easy pipe alignment and welding, making them ideal for high-pressure and extreme temperature conditions. Each type caters to different industrial requirements, ensuring proper pipe connections and reliable performance.</p></p>
