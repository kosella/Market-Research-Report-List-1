<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rebreather for Diving Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Circuit</li><li>Semi-Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rebreather for diving market consists of two main types: closed circuit and semi-closed circuit. In closed circuit rebreathers, the exhaled breath is circulated through a scrubber which removes carbon dioxide and then re-injected with oxygen for the diver to breathe again. This results in minimal gas bubbles and longer dive times. Semi-closed circuit rebreathers also recycle exhaled breath but release a portion of it as bubbles. They require less complex systems and maintenance compared to closed circuit rebreathers, making them more suitable for recreational divers.</p></p>
