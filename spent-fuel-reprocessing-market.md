<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spent Fuel Reprocessing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Fuel Cycle</li><li>Open Fuel Cycle</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Spent Fuel Reprocessing Market can be categorized into two types - Closed Fuel Cycle and Open Fuel Cycle. In the Closed Fuel Cycle market, spent fuel is reprocessed to extract remaining usable materials, which are then utilized to produce new fuel. This process allows for more efficient utilization of resources and reduces waste. On the other hand, the Open Fuel Cycle market involves the direct disposal of spent fuel without reprocessing. This approach is simpler and cheaper but leads to higher waste accumulation and potential resource wastage.</p></p>
