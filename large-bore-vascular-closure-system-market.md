<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large Bore Vascular Closure System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Closure Devices</li><li>Passive Closure Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Large Bore Vascular Closure System Market includes two main types: Active Closure Devices and Passive Closure Devices. Active Closure Devices are designed to actively close the arterial puncture site by using sutures, clips, or other methods, providing more control over the closure process. Passive Closure Devices, on the other hand, rely on the body's natural ability to form clots to close the puncture site without external intervention. Both types aim to minimize complications and improve patient outcomes after large bore vascular procedures.</p></p>
