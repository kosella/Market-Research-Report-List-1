<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Permanent Pacemaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-chamber Pacemaker</li><li>Dual-chamber Pacemaker</li><li>Three-chamber Pacemaker/Biventricular Pacemaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Permanent Pacemaker market consists of three main types: Single-chamber Pacemaker, Dual-chamber Pacemaker, and Three-chamber Pacemaker/Biventricular Pacemaker. Single-chamber Pacemakers are most commonly used and involve one lead that stimulates either the atrium or the ventricle. Dual-chamber Pacemakers utilize two leads to stimulate both the atrium and ventricle, allowing for synchronized heartbeat. Three-chamber Pacemakers, also known as Biventricular Pacemakers, have three leads and are used in patients with severe heart failure. These pacemakers synchronize the contractions of the left and right ventricles, improving heart function.</p></p>
