<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Logic Comparator ICs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Collector</li><li>Totem-Pole</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Logic comparator ICs are electronic devices used to compare two input signals and provide an output signal indicating whether one signal is greater, equal to, or less than the other. Open collector and totem-pole are two common types of output configurations for these ICs. Open collector outputs provide an output signal only when the compared signals are not equal, while totem-pole outputs provide both high and low states, allowing bidirectional flow of current. The choice between these types depends on the specific application requirements, such as the need for bus sharing or driving capacitive loads.</p></p>
