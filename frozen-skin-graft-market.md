<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Frozen Skin Graft Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Split-thickness</li><li>Full-thickness</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Frozen skin grafts are a type of treatment for severe burns, injuries, or chronic wounds. There are two main types of frozen skin grafts: split-thickness and full-thickness grafts. Split-thickness grafts involve removing a thin layer of skin, which includes the top layers of the epidermis and part of the dermis, and transplanting it onto the recipient site. Full-thickness grafts, on the other hand, involve removing the entire thickness of the skin, including both the epidermis and the dermis, for transplantation. Both types of grafts aim to promote healing and restore function to the affected area.</p></p>
