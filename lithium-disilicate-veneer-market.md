<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lithium Disilicate Veneer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>200-300 MPa</li><li>300-400 MPa</li><li>More Than 400MPa</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lithium Disilicate Veneer is available in three market types based on their flexural strength: 200-300 MPa, 300-400 MPa, and more than 400 MPa. The flexural strength determines the veneer's ability to resist bending or breaking under pressure. Veneers with a flexural strength of 200-300 MPa are ideal for patients with less occlusal load, while those in the 300-400 MPa range are suitable for normal biting forces. Veneers with more than 400 MPa flexural strength are recommended for patients with heavy occlusal forces or bruxism.</p></p>
