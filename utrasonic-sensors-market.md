<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Utrasonic Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Proximity Sensors</li><li>Retro-Reflective Sensors</li><li>Through Beam Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultrasonic sensors have three main types in the market. Proximity sensors are used to detect the presence of objects without physical contact and are commonly used in automated systems. Retro-reflective sensors use a reflective surface to bounce the ultrasonic waves back to the sensor, allowing detection of an object's presence or absence. Through beam sensors consist of a transmitter and a receiver placed opposite to each other, detecting an object when it interrupts the ultrasonic waves between them. These sensors find applications in various industries such as manufacturing and robotics.</p></p>
