<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fuel Tank Alarm Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ultrasonic Type</li><li>Float Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fuel tank alarm market comprises two main types - Ultrasonic Type and Float Type. The Ultrasonic Type utilizes ultrasonic waves to measure the level of fuel in the tank and triggers an alarm when it reaches a certain level. On the other hand, the Float Type uses a float mechanism that rises and falls with the fuel level, activating the alarm when it reaches a predetermined threshold. Both types provide a warning system for fuel tank levels, ensuring efficient fuel management and preventing overflows or shortages.</p></p>
