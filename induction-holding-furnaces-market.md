<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Induction Holding Furnaces Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coreless Holding Furnaces</li><li>Channel Holding Furnaces</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Induction holding furnaces are used in industrial processes to maintain the molten metal at a desired temperature for casting operations. Coreless holding furnaces have a coil wound around a crucible, offering flexibility in shape and size, making them suitable for a wide range of metals. On the other hand, channel holding furnaces have a loop-shaped coil located around a channel, allowing for a higher metal flow rate during casting. Both types provide efficient metal heating and temperature control, but differ in their design and application.</p></p>
