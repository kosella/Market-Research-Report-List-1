<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Unconventional gas refers to natural gas resources that are trapped within unconventional reservoirs, requiring advanced extraction techniques. Shale gas is obtained from organic-rich rocks called shale through hydraulic fracturing or "fracking." Coalbed gas is found within coal seams and is extracted by pumping out water to release the gas. Tight gas is trapped within low-porosity rocks, which are fractured to access the gas. "Others" refer to additional types such as methane hydrates, deep gas, and gas from oil shale. These unconventional gas market types provide alternative sources of natural gas to traditional conventional gas reservoirs.</p></p>
