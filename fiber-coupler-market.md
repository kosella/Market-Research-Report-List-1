<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Coupler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Mode Couplers</li><li>Multimode Couplers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The fiber coupler market is divided into two main types: single mode couplers and multimode couplers. Single mode couplers are designed for single mode fibers, which have a small core size and are optimized for long-distance communication. They enable the combination of signals from multiple fibers into a single output or the splitting of a single input signal into multiple outputs. On the other hand, multimode couplers are designed for multimode fibers, which have a larger core size and are suitable for shorter-distance communication. They perform the same signal combining and splitting functions but for multimode fibers.</p></p>
