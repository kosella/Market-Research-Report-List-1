<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CO2 Insufflator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic Type</li><li>Semi-Automatic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CO2 insufflator market includes two types: automatic and semi-automatic. Automatic insufflators are designed to maintain a constant pressure of carbon dioxide during laparoscopic surgeries without manual intervention. They offer convenience and accuracy by automatically adjusting the pressure level. On the other hand, semi-automatic insufflators require some manual input to set and adjust the CO2 pressure during the surgery. While they may require more attention from the surgeon, they can be more cost-effective. Both types serve the purpose of creating a clear surgical view by inflating the abdomen with carbon dioxide.</p></p>
