<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vapour Recovery Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-type Recovery</li><li>Closed-type Recovery</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Vapour Recovery Units (VRUs) are devices used to capture and recover harmful vapours that evaporate during the transfer of volatile substances, such as gasoline or chemicals. There are two main types of VRUs: open-type recovery and closed-type recovery. Open-type recovery systems collect vapours through an open vent, allowing them to escape into the atmosphere. Closed-type recovery systems, on the other hand, use a sealed system to capture and process the vapours, preventing their release into the environment. Closed-type recovery systems are considered more environmentally friendly and efficient in reducing emissions.</p></p>
