<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Reinsurance Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Proportional Reinsurance</li><li>Non-proportional Reinsurance</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine reinsurance can be categorized into two main types: proportional reinsurance and non-proportional reinsurance. Proportional reinsurance involves sharing both premiums and losses between the original insurer and the reinsurer, based on a predetermined percentage. This type allows for a more balanced risk distribution. On the other hand, non-proportional reinsurance only covers losses that exceed a specified threshold, and the reinsurer's involvement is limited to these excess losses. This type is suitable for catastrophic events or large losses, providing additional protection to the original insurer.</p></p>
